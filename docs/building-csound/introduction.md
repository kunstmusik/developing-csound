# Introduction 

In this first part of this workshop, we will spend time to get familiar with the Csound source code and build process. We will be using three main platforms: macOS, Windows, and Linux. Additionally, we will look at building and running Csound using three main IDEs: XCode, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. 

By the end of this part of the workshop, you should be able to:

1. Use git to clone the Csound repository
2. Use git to switch branches to test out new features or bug fixes
3. Build Csound from source and install/or configure it to your system
4. Start to be come familiar with Csound development on your own machine as well as have exposure to seeing how Csound is built on different platforms.
