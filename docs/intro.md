# Developing Csound - Introduction

This workshop will help you get started with developing Csound. We will be using three main platforms: macOS, Windows, and Linux. The workkshop is roughly divided into four parts: 

* __Part 1 - Building Csound:__ We will go through the steps to build Csound on macOS, Windows, and Linux. We will also look at building and running Csound using three main IDEs: XCode, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. 

* __Part 2 - Source Code Walkthrough:__ A guided tour of Csound's source code. We will work IDEs and their tools to navigate the source code to understand how Csound is organized and how it works. 

* __Part 3 - Debugging Csound:__ We will look at how to debug Csound using various tools and techniques.  

* __Part 4 - Additional Topics:__ As time permits, we will cover additional topics such as optimizing Csound, measuring performance, and working with Csound on different platforms.
